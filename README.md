# Simple Chess Game

Naive implementation of a chess game, serving as an initial step into the world of chess programming.


This project is a great opportunity to discover the challenges involved in creating a chess program. That nicely points out why designing and thinking ahead about the structure is beneficial in programming.


Commits are made succinct on purpose to track the step-by-step evolution.


This project is currenlty under development. Comments and suggestions are welcome.

### Usage

[Standard Algebraic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_chess) would be used for moving pieces. 


Each piece is identified by the an uppercase letter, giving `K` for king, `Q` for queen, `R` for rook, `B` for bishop, and `N` for knight.


So, moving a knight as a first move could be either `Nc3` or `Nf3`. For pawn moves, only the destination square is enough to make a move, for example `d4` (pawn moves to d4).


### Installation

comming soon
